Some of my interests include watching YouTube content, listening to music, making music, coding, and fictional writing, among many other things.<br><br>I don't really consider myself skilled in most areas, but if I had to chose, I have at least a little skill in music performance/production and coding.<br><br>If you're curious this is not a random picture! I actually took this picture at a UCI event!<br><br>Aside from that, if you're reading this I hope you're having a great day!</div>
