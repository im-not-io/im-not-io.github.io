            <div class="mainContentBox hidden" id="mainContentBox">I'm passionate about using technology and the arts to positively impact people's lives. Some of my interests include watching YouTube content, listening to music, making music, coding, and fictional writing, among many other things.<br><br>I don't really consider myself skilled in most areas, but if I had to chose, I have at least a little skill in music performance/production and coding.<br><br>If you're curious this is not a random picture! I actually took this picture at a UCI event!<br><br>Aside from that, if you're reading this I hope you're having a great day!</div>
