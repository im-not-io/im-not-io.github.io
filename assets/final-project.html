                <h1>User interviews</h1>
                <span>
                    User interviews are an important tool to help gauge features and improvements you want to add to your website. Unfortunately, the types of questions I asked were far too vague or off topic which resulted in responses that weren't as in-depth as I had hoped. Questions I asked queried about the desired features and concerns people had about the website, which helped a bit, but I should have created my own questions instead of using the stock questions provided. What I realized is that the quality of questions you ask will affect the quality of answers you will receive. While my user interviews didn't persuade me to add any new features to my site, they helped convince me to leave certain features on my site. For example, a couple of the people I interviewed said I should include pictures so I ended up leaving in a feature I added on my site which swaps the page's background image every time the page is refreshed.

                <h1>Competitor analysis</h1>
                <span>The competitor analysis, in the context of website design, is a method which examines various websites similar to the one you are building in hope of learning from those sites and using that new found knowledge to improve your own website. In my competitor analysis I tried to focus on other "personal websites"/portfolio websites. I reviewed the sites I reviewed because I wanted to get inspiration on how to design my website. For example, one website I examined was Ian Cinnamon's <a href="http://www.icinnamon.org/" target="_blank">website</a> who is also a programmer and shares some similarities with me. Ultimately, I ended up using a large background image like he did on his site. To help get a broad spectrum of inspiration I analyzed a number of different sites including a software engineer/creative, an instructor, a digital designer, and a web designer/coder.</span>

                <h1>Feature value matrix</h1>
                <span>The feature value matrix is a tool which helps you determine which features are most important to your site and helps determine whether or not they should be included. I didn't really have a particular method for selecting the features I selected in my feature value matrix, I just kind of thought of things off the top of my head. What the feature value matrix is good for, however, is you can use it to get a sense of what really is feasible for the site. In the final version of my site I ended up only completing some of the things that had a better score on the feature value matrix. Some of the features I wanted, but scored poorly on the feature value matrix I was unable to implement. What makes the feature value matrix so useful and why I'd probably use it in the future is because it helps you focus on the most essential features your site really needs.</span>

                <h1>Feature prioritization</h1>
                <span>I prioritized features mainly on whether I thought the feature was important and whether or not I believed it was feasible within the time given.  This feature prioritization is useful in determining which features are must-haves for the website. It also helps by visually showing the different features being considered for implementation and the order in which they should be implemented in. Sometimes even though a feature was a really cool idea, it ended up getting lower priority on the feature prioritization because it had a high technical effort level. For example, I wanted to do a video capture-and-upload application, but time didn’t permit that. Overall, the feature prioritization is a great tool for helping you manage the features you want to include on your website.</span>

                <h1>User stories</h1>
                <span>User stories are akin to an interaction design method in software engineering called personas, they help get a sense of the different types of users and how they might use your software/website. The reason why user stories are important is because they allow us to identify our website's expected audience and how we can tailor our site to meet their needs. I tried to select a diverse set of people when choosing my stories including a teacher, a student, a hiring manager, a parent, a programmer, and just a general person browsing the web. By selecting all these different types of user stories I can get a feel for the audience of my website. For example, I realized a parent might not be as well-versed in using websites versus a college student and I hope to keep that in mind when designing my website.</span>

                <h1>Cognitive walkthrough</h1>
                <span>
                A cognitive walkthough is when you "walkthough" your website with someone and ask them various questions about the site and its functionality. A cognitive walkthrough is a great way of understand how real-life users will interact with your website. Out of all the activities I did the cognitive walkthrough was one of the most helpful since it gave me specific details that helped me improve my website. For example, the cognitive walkthoughs helped me realize some users had trouble realizing that my about me page had a drop down link that revealed content. The biggest challenge with cognitive walkthroughs in my opinion is actually meeting with people. I'm not very social so it's difficult me to communicate with people both in person or through video chat. Another issue I faced with the cognitive walkthroughs is time. I should have allotted for more time so I could get more detailed data on how to improve my site.

                <h1>User test</h1>
                <span>I conducted two types of tests for user testing a clicktest and a question test. The clicktest was to get make sure the website was easy to navigate. The question test was just to help get data on how I can make the website better. One challenge I faced was people who didn't actually answer the questions. Another challenge was that I believe people took these tests very quickly and it's hard to say whether or not that may have created inaccurate results. Finally, I faced the challenge of divided opinions, where people's opinions on a particular feature were mixed which made it difficult to determine whether or not to keep that feature as is or modify/remove it. A high-level summary of my findings from user testing is as follows: overall people were able to navigate the website successfully, most people found the website visually appealing, most people didn’t think any links would open in a new window, some people didn’t realize there was hidden content on the about me page, people wanted a bigger font size and a brighter background, and there were mixed opinions on whether or not a changing background image was appealing or not.</span>

        <h1 class="mainTitle">Summary of findings</h1>
        <div class="cardBlock blockOfText"><div>There was a variety of different research I did and after sifting through all the data I discovered several things. From the user interviews I was able to get a sense of what users expected to see in a personal/portfolio website as well as potential features to include. For example, a couple people suggested to have pictures on the site. However, while it was still good to get different people’s perspectives, one of the challenges I faced was general and untargeted questions. If I had asked more specific questions I would have gotten a lot better details on how to improve my website. That challenge is the main reason why the user interviews weren’t as helpful as I would have hoped. The competitor analysis was also helpful to give me inspiration on how my site visually should look, for example I found that Ian Cinnamon’s website featured a large header image which is something I decided I want to have in my website. The feature value matrix helped me to carefully consider the different features I was planning to include in my website and to determine if they were feasible or not. Notably, the poor score on the video capture-and-uploader application hinted that that feature would be too difficult to include in the final website. The feature prioritization didn’t help me too much since I felt like it used the data from the feature value matrix anyways. A challenge I had when drawing the Kano model on the feature value prioritization was I wasn’t quite sure where to place all the boxes and that made the visual model less helpful to me.</div><div>The user stories were helpful in getting a sense of the different types of users that might use my website. I think what I probably learn most from that is that you need to pay attention and try to build a website that caters to all different types of people. For example, people with poor vision might not favor smaller text.  I think one challenge with the user stories I had was identifying the right genres of people to include, especially since having a good selection of different genres of people is essential for user stories to work most effectively. Of course, in addition to user stories there was the cognitive walkthrough which was as I mentioned earlier one of the most helpful data-gathering tools I used. From the cognitive walkthrough I learned that people struggled to notice there was click-the-link-to-reveal body of text in the about me page. I also learned that people would have preferred a form on the contact page instead of a link to an email address. Finally, there was the user testing. As I previously mentioned, my findings from user testing are as follows: overall people were able to navigate the website successfully, most people found the website visually appealing, most people didn’t think any links would open in a new window, some people didn’t realize there was hidden content on the about me page, people wanted a bigger font size and a brighter background, and there were mixed opinions on whether or not a changing background image was appealing or not.</div>
</div>
                <h1 class="mainTitle">Incorporation of Findings</h1>
        <div class="cardBlock blockOfText end"><div>There are several ways in which I incorporated my findings into my final website. For one, I implemented a large background image similar to one I found in Ian Cinnamon’s personal website, one of the sites I analyzed in my competitor analysis. This was actually a bit of a tricky thing for me because I had a tough time getting the image to fill the whole screen and preventing it from resizing itself when the mobile URL bar disappears (it creates a jumping effect). Ultimately, I wasn’t actually able to solve this challenge, unfortunately. Another change I made was a modified the about me page to no longer have any click-link-to-open content since according to my user question test some people didn’t realize there was hidden content. I definitely kept photos in my site, as people in my user interviews suggested. I also tried to keep the site creative as someone suggested in a user interview.</div>
            <div>
                I think even more important than the changes I actually made are the changes I need to make in the future. One of the flaws of my website is I used a lot of newer CSS code which doesn’t work on older browsers and I didn’t provide a fallback mainly because I didn’t have enough time. I used these newer methods because I set out to build my website without using responsive grid framework to help style my site (as the instructor suggested for the midterm) but as a result it makes my site non-functional on older devices. In fact, on a Galaxy S4 browser the menu bar doesn’t even show up! Sadly, I don’t have any more time to commit to this project, but in the future I would rewrite it using a framework of some sort to help provide better overall device and browser support. For me one of the biggest challenges was trying to make the site work on both mobile/tablet devices and the browser and a framework would really help with that. I mainly accomplished this support by using media queries when needed in addition to CSS flexbox. Another challenge I had was docking things and centering things which would have been probably solved by using a framework, though I did mostly solve this problem using flexbox and CSS margin stuff. So in the future I plan to rewrite this using a framework as well as assure to test it works on multiple devices (including older ones). I feel like one of the biggest lessons I learned is that I shouldn’t have tried to reinvent the wheel and just used a framework to save me time and focus on the functionality and design of my site instead of endlessly tweaking CSS.</div>
